# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system. It is used to track changes in source code and manage different versions of the same project.

## Installation

```sh
scoop install git
```

## Usage & Commands

### `git clone`

Clone a repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
```

### `git add`

Add all changes to the staging area.

```sh
git add .
# or
git add -A
```

Add a specific file/directory to the staging area.

```sh
git add *filename/path*
```

> [!TIP]
> (\*) stands for a wildcard and will match any file or directory.
> Running `git add *` or `git add .` will add all modified/new files and
> directories to the staging area.

### `git restore`

Restore a file/directory from the staging area (`git add`-ed file/s).

```sh
git restore --staged *filename/path*
```

May also be used to restore a file/directory from the working directory. (_"Discard changes"_)

```sh
git restore *filename/path*
```

> [!TIP]
> Same as `git add`, you can use wildcards to restore multiple files/directories.

### `git commit`

Commit all changes to the local repository.

```sh
git commit -m "commit message"
```

### `git push`

Push all commits to the remote repository.

```sh
git push
```

Push a specific branch to the remote repository.

```sh
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### `git pull`

Pull all commits from the remote repository.

```sh
git pull
```

Pull a specific branch from the remote repository.

```sh
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

#### Flags

Flags that can be used with git pull in specific scenarios.

- `--rebase`: Rebase the current branch on top of the upstream branch.
- `--autostash`: Automatically stash/unstash changes before/after a pull.

### `git log`

Show the commit history.

```sh
git log
```

#### Flags

Flags that can be used with git log in specific scenarios.

- `--oneline`: Show the commit history in a single line.

### `git reflog`

I rarely use this command, but in cases like when you accidentally delete a
branch without pushing it to the remote repository, you can use this command
to restore the deleted branch.

```sh
git reflog
```

### `git rebase`

Rebase the currently active branch.

```sh
git rebase <branch name>
```

```sh
# Assuming we're we want to rebase our current
# branch to the latest changes from the main
git rebase main
```

If we're on a different branch, we can specify the branch name and we want
rebase a specific branch, we can use the following command:

```sh
git rebase <branch name> <branch name>
```

### `git branch`

List all branches.

```sh
git branch
```

Create a new branch.

```sh
git branch <branch name>
```

Delete a branch.

```sh
git branch -d <branch name>
# or
git branch -D <branch name>
```

Rename a branch.

```sh
git branch -m <old branch name> <new branch name>
# or if we're on the branch
git branch -m <new branch name>
```

### `git checkout`

Switch to an existing branch.

```sh
git checkout <branch name>
```

We can also checkout to a specific commit by copying the commit hash from
the commit history using `git log` or `git reflog`.

### `git switch`

Is a somewhat more advanced version of `git checkout`.

Switch to an existing branch.

```sh
git switch <branch name>
# it is essentially the same as
# git checkout <branch name>
```

Unlike `git checkout`, switch can bring local changes to the branch you're
switching to.

#### Flags

Flags that can be used with git switch in specific scenarios.

- `-c`: Create a new branch if it doesn't exist and switch to it. (It is essentially the same as creating a new branch branch using `git branch` and then switching to it using `git checkout`.)

### `git stash`

Stash changes.

```sh
git stash
```

#### Flags

Flags that can be used with git stash in specific scenarios.

- `-u`: Include untracked (new) files in the stash.

### `git stash pop`

Readd the changes from the stash.

```sh
git stash pop
```

## Development workflow

1. Clone a repo using `git clone`
2. After making changes, use `git add` to add the changes to the staging area
3. Switch to a new branch using `git switch -c <branch name>`
4. Make sure the `main`/`master` branch by running `git fetch origin main:main` (This command is not on the list above, as we will only use it this one time).
   - _or if you want to update a different branch, run `git fetch origin <branch name>:<branch name>`_
5. Use `git rebase main` to rebase the current branch on top of the `main` branch.
6. Use `git push` to push the changes to the remote repository
