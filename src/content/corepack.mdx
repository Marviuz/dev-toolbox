# Corepack

Corepack is a zero-runtime-dependency Node.js script that acts as a bridge between Node.js projects and the package managers they are intended to be used with during development.

## Usage & Commands

As of September 2024, Corepack is still bundled with Node so we don't
need to install it. But there are plans to make it an independent package.

### `corepack enable`

Enable Corepack

```sh
corepack enable
```

If the `package.json` doesn't have a `packageManager` field, it will be added automatically.
The added `packageManager` field has a dirty look value but can be manually cleaned.
to make it look like this:

```json:package.json {10}
{
  "name": "project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.10.0"
}
```

### `corepack disable`

Disable Corepack

```sh
corepack disable
```

_Note: Sometimes we may need to use a different runtime such as bun. This is the time we need to disable Corepack._
