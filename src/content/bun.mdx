# Bun

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is a JavaScript runtime, package manager, test runner and bundler
built from scratch using the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) programming language which
is also known to be **BLAZINGLY FAST** like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

It's 4x faster than [Node.js](./node) (_Even if it's not 4x, it's still faster in my experience which
makes it a great choice simple projects like this one_).

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install Bun. Two of which are:

- [Scoop](./scoop)
- or through Node's package managers

```sh
# Using Scoop
scoop install bun

# Using NPM
npm install -g bun
```

## Usage & Commands

If you've used node package managers before, you'll be familiar with Bun's commands.

Moving forward, we can assume some of the commands are the same as `yarn/pnpm`
as well as the flags that are often used.

### `bun add`

Really similar to `yarn/pnpm add`.

```sh
bun add <package>
```

### `bun run`

Really similar to `yarn/pnpm run`. We can omit `run` like `yarn/pnpm`

```sh
bun run <script>
# or
bun <script>

# Example
bun dev
bun start
```

_Note: Not sure if it's only for windows, but for `build` script, we need to
use `bun run build` instead of `bun build` or we'll encounter an error saying
something along the lines of `bun build is used to build bun` or something._

### `bun install`

Really similar to `yarn/pnpm install`.

```sh
bun install <package>
```

### `bun remove`

Really similar to `yarn/pnpm remove`.

```sh
bun remove <package>
```
