# Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) is a way to manage your versioning and changelogs

## Installation

More information from their [docs](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)

_Note: The rest of this guide assumes you're using `npm`. But you can use `pnpm`, `yarn`
or whatever you like._

```sh
npm install @changesets/cli && npx changeset init
```

## Usage & Commands

### `npx changeset`

This will start the interactive CLI to create a new changeset.
Unlike commits, changesets are meant to be a proper english sentence.

```sh
npx changeset
```

## Manual versioning

Versioning your app/package is usually done in the CI. In case you're
in a situation where you don't have access to the CI, you can use the
following commands to bump the version.

\_Note: The rest of this guide assumes you're using `npm`. But you can use `pnpm`, `yarn`

1. Be sure to have the latest commit in your `main` by running `git pull`
2. Bump the version by running `npm changeset version`. This will...
   - Bump the version in `package.json`
   - Create or update the `CHANGELOG.md` file
3. Commit the changes. Preferably, use a semantic commit message.
   - `git commit -m "chore(release): version application"`
4. Push the changes to the remote repository
5. Switch to `production` branch and rebase it from `main`.
6. Push the changes to the remote repository.
7. And your done!
