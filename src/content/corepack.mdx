# Corepack

Corepack is a zero-runtime-dependency Node.js script that acts as a bridge between Node.js projects and the package managers they are intended to be used with during development.

## Usage & Commands

As of September 2024, Corepack is still bundled with Node so we don't
need to install it. But there are plans to make it an independent package.

### `corepack enable`

Enable Corepack

```sh
corepack enable
```

After enabling Corepack, and then running a command with a specific package manager,
you will see a new `packageManager` field in your `package.json` file. If if doesn't
have one. The added `packageManager` field has a dirty look value but can be manually
cleaned. to make it look like this:

```json:package.json {10}
{
  "name": "project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.10.0"
}
```

If it already has a `packageManager` field and you tried to use a different package manager,
the command will fail with an error message saying that the package manager you should use
is the one that's in the `packageManager` field.

### `corepack disable`

Disable Corepack

```sh
corepack disable
```

> [!NOTE]
> Sometimes we may need to use a different runtime such as [bun](./bun). This is the time we need to disable Corepack.
